# My-processing-sketches

This is going to be for all my processing sketches which i made back in class 11 and 12 for fun. This is just me experimenting and getting comfortable with graphical programming, figuring out the basics and fundamentals to displaying and updating a window, figuring out the basics of a physics engine and applying vector mathematics to calculate updates to the display window. A lot of the ideas were inspired from Daniel Shiffman. A lot of the ideas are pretty amatuerish but they were fun to make.
